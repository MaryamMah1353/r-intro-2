# Introduction {#index}

These are course notes for the "Introduction to R" course given by the Monash Bioinformatics Platform. This is a new version of the course focussing on the modern [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) set of packages. We believe this is currently the quickest route to being productive in R.

During the workshop we will be using R on a server we run. However R is free, and you can install it on your own computer. There are two things to download and install:

* [Download R](https://cran.rstudio.com/)

* [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

R is the language itself, and RStudio provides a convenient environment in which to use R.
