# Introduction {#index}

These are course notes for the "Introduction to R" course given by the Monash Bioinformatics Platform. This is a new version of the course focussing on the modern "Tidyverse" set of packages. We believe this is currently the quickest route to being productive in R.

These workshop notes are online at https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-intro-2/index.html
