# Summarizing data

Having loaded and thoroughly explored a data set, and not before, we are ready to distill it down to concise conclusions. At its simplest, this involves calculating summary statistics like counts, means, and standard deviations. Beyond this is the fitting of models, and hypothesis testing and confidence interval calculation. R has a huge number of packages devoted to these tasks, and this is a large part of its appeal, but this is largely beyond the scope of today.
